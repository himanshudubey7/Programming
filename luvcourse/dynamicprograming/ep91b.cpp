There is a frog who is initially on Stone 1. He will repeat the following action some number of times to reach Stone N:

If the frog is currently on Stone i, jump to one of the following: Stone i+1,i+2,…,i+K. Here, a cost of ∣hi - hj∣ is incurred, where j is the stone to land on.



Find the minimum possible total cost incurred before the frog reaches Stone N.
